## ðŸ’» About

Unique Login is an app that demonstrates a little about AnimatedContainer wave animation, which can be applied to many other apps. The authentication process does not use any backend for validation. However, it uses RegEx for email/password validation, and the only correct credentials are: email: 'teste@teste.com.br' senha: '123456789+'.
The second screen is an async call to the users from JSON Placeholder. It also works for the WEB!
